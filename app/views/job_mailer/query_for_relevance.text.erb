Hey,

Thanks for listing your job (<%= job_url @job, only_path: false %>) at the Ruby Underground job board!

We will tell Ruby Underground members that you are looking for a <%= @job.name %> in the next meetup, which will be held on <%= @upcoming_event_time %>.
If you are not looking for a <%= @job.name %> any more, please reply to this e-mail and let me know.

Thanks,
Omer Lachish-Rauchwerger
